# hobbs_lootprops
This script allows players to interact with various world objects (e.g., wrecked vehicles, trees, or any other prop) to search for and collect customizable loot. Players can interact with these objects via a target system, which triggers a progress bar and plays a welding animation (or any other animation you set) during the search process.
Key Features:
- Customizable Props: You can configure any prop in the game (e.g., cars, trucks, trees) for players to interact with and gather resources.
- Custom Loot System: Define any type of loot (e.g., scrap, wood, metal, or custom items) with random quantities for each prop.
- Limited Searches: Each prop can only be searched a limited number of times (default: 3) before entering a cooldown period (default: 5 minutes).
- Progress Bar & Animation: A customizable progress bar and animation play while the player interacts with the prop.
- Inventory Check & Ground Drop: If the player cannot carry all the loot, excess items are dropped on the ground for later collection.

Important Configurations:
- Props: Define which props can be searched, what loot they provide, the number of searches allowed, and cooldown periods.
- Loot: Customizable loot options, allowing you to specify any items with variable quantities.
- Animations: Customizable animation and prop used during the search process (default: welding).
- Texts: Customizable messages for players (e.g., loot received, inventory full).

This script is highly flexible, allowing you to turn any world object into a source of loot, with fully customizable items and interactions.
